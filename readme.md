[![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/Your-Username/Your-Project)

This project is designed to simplify GoLang development by providing live reloading capabilities using Air, all set up and ready to go with Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Docker**: You can download and install Docker from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Installation

Follow these simple steps to run your GoLang project with live reloading:

1. Clone the project repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/masoudfesahat/golang-air.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd golang-air
   ```

3. Start the development environment using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will set up the environment and your GoLang app with Air for live reloading.

## Usage

Your GoLang application is now running with live reloading enabled. You can start making changes to your code, and the changes will be automatically reflected in your running application.
